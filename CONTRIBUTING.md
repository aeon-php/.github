## Development 💻

Supported Operating Systems

* MacOS 
* Linux 

PHP Version required for development is defined in composer.json in `require` section. It's always the minimum supported version.
Beside PHP two other tools are required for development. 

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) 
* [Phive](https://phar.io/#Install) 

In order to install dependencies and tools please execute following commands in the root folder of the repository. 

```bash
composer install --prefer-dist
phive install --force-accept-unsigned
```

## Tests & Metrics 📊

Before opening pull request please run whole test suite locally using `composer build`. 

Code Coverage & Type Coverage - we expect both metrics to stay at 100% level. 

## Coding Standards ⌨️

Coding standards across all aeon libraries are unified and automated, you just need execute `composer cs:php:fix` from CLI.

## Versioning 🗂

All aeon libraries are following https://semver.org/. Latest unreleased version is always represented by the default branch. 
For example if default branch is `2.x` it means that the next stable release is going to be `2.0.0` and current stable release is somewhere 
between `1.0.0` and `2.0.0`. 

Our plan is to support at least 3 stable versions at time. 
Bug fixes should be sent to the latest one and then if possible to the 2 older versions. 

## Changelog 📝

Don't forget to update CHANGELOG.md file according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) guidelines.  

## Pull Requests ✅

Please make sure to provide description to every pull request you open. This makes maintainers life easier. 
If possible provide a context for the change, if for example you need a new functionality in your project try to briefly explain your use case.
Some changes might affect other libraries or other people code, if possible try to explain where and how your changes might break backward compatibility 
so the maintainers can assign it to the right milestone (milestones represents new releases).

Maintainers might ask you some additional questions before they proceed with code review, please be mindful, their time is limited and their work is free. 

## Questions 🔍

Feel free to open issue with any questions you have regarding development.
